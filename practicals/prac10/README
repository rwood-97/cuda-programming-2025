The Flamingo package was developed by Ben Spencer in 2011:

The differences between the current version of the software
and the original tar file are:

1) use of python2 instead of python at the top of the autotune script

2) an updated version of the laplace3d example based on the current
   laplace3d in Practical 3

At some point it might be worth trying out this tool to convert
python2 to python3:
